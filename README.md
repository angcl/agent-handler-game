# Spyce Town - A Linux Game Jam 2022 submission

Spyce Town is a game in which you are put in the role of a spy manager that has to work under pressure, because of staff shortage.

You have to solve different tasks, for example disabling a camera or downloading files. Each failed task decreases the reputation, once it is at zero you have lost the game.
